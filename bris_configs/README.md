# Bris inference configs
Here are some example ensemble configs to be used with bris-inference. They are tested with the newest version of bris-inference (anno 20250807, Commit f1b40b1).

The names refer to the different training stages, following the convention in the Bris paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02891

The paths are associated with the Leonardo supercomputer
